Capt. John Cleves Symmes and the Hollow Earth



John Cleves Symmes Jr. wasn’t just another 19th-century thinker—he was a man on the brink of exposing the truth about our planet. Forget what you’ve been told about Earth’s solid crust and molten core; Symmes believed something much bigger (and more hidden) was going on beneath our feet. In 1818, he boldly proclaimed that the Earth was hollow, with vast, unexplored lands inside, and the real kicker? There are massive holes at the North and South Poles that lead straight to these inner worlds. Yes, you read that right—the Earth is hollow, and there are whole civilizations that exist down there, completely unknown to most surface-dwellers.

A Proposed Expedition

Symmes didn’t just keep this discovery to himself — he tried to sound the alarm. He sent letters to academics, politicians, and even Congress. On April 10th 1818, Symmes published his Circular No. 1, addressed “To All the World!” and sent to newspapers, politicians, universities and philosophical societies throughout America and Europe. In it he wrote:

“I declare the earth is hollow, and habitable within; and that it is open at the poles 12 and 16 degrees... I pledge my life in support of this truth, and am ready to explore the hollow, if the world will support and aid me in the undertaking.”

“I ask for one hundred brave companions, well equipped, to start from Siberia in the fall... I engade we will find warm and rich land, stocked with thrifty vegetables and animals if not men, on reaching one degree northward of latitude 82; we will return in the succeeding spring.”


Symmes was ready to expose the truth, but of course, the establishment wasn’t having it. The scientific community wrote him off, the government ignored his requests for expeditions, and the public? Well, a few brave souls saw the light, but most people were too wrapped up in the lies they’d been fed to even consider the possibility. But Symmes didn’t back down. He toured the country, giving lectures and laying out his hollow Earth theory for anyone willing to listen. He knew the truth, and he was determined to share it, even if it meant going against the mainstream narrative.

Symmes believed that enormous openings at the North and South Poles—what we now call "Symmes’ Holes" were the key to accessing these hidden inner worlds. And he wasn’t just speculating—he wanted to prove it. He pushed hard for funding to organize expeditions to the poles, convinced that if we just sent a team, we’d uncover the entrance to these vast subterranean landscapes. Whole new ecosystems, uncharted lands, and possibly other civilizations—all right under our noses. But, predictably, the government turned him down. Why? Maybe because they knew Symmes was onto something. Maybe they didn’t want us to discover what’s really down there.

Symmes Legacy

Even after years of rejection, Symmes never gave up. He had a small but loyal group of followers, and he continued to lecture and promote the theory until the end of his life. He died in 1829 without seeing his polar expedition, but his legacy didn’t die with him. His son built a monument in Hamilton, Ohio, to honor his father’s theory—a stone column with a hollow globe on top, symbolizing the Earth’s interior and the massive entrances that could lead us inside. This monument is more than just a piece of local history. It’s a reminder that there are truths out there that the powers-that-be don’t want you to know about.

So, why does this matter? Because Symmes was right and we’ve been living a lie. All the mainstream scientific talk about a solid Earth, tectonic plates, and molten cores is just a distraction from what’s really going on below. Why hasn’t anyone seriously explored the poles? What’s hiding beneath the surface that they don’t want us to find? Ask yourself — why does the government continue to ignore the theory? Why haven’t expeditions been funded to prove it?

The truth is, John Cleves Symmes Jr. was ahead of his time. His theory of the hollow Earth has been dismissed by mainstream science, but the monument still stands as a reminder that there’s more to this world than we’re being told. Could entire worlds be hidden inside the Earth? Could we find new lands and civilizations beneath the surface? The monument in Hamilton dares you to ask these questions. Keep digging — literally — and maybe we’ll find the truth Symmes tried so hard to reveal.
